#text(size: 15pt, )[*Ownership rules*]\
1 - Every value in Rust is owned by a single variable, which acts as its "owner."\
2- Ownership is exclusiveâ€”only one variable can own a value at a time.\
3 - When the owner variable goes out of scope (is no longer used), the value is automatically removed from memory.\
4- This system ensures efficient memory management without requiring manual cleanup.


#text(size: 15pt, )[*Borrowing rules*]\
1 - At any moment, you can either have a single mutable reference or multiple immutable references to a value.\
2 - References must remain valid and never point to invalid or deallocated memory.


#text(size: 20pt, )[*Creating references*]
```rust 
let s1 = String::from("hello world!");
let s1_ref = &s1; // immutable reference
let mut s2 = String::from("hello");
let s2_ref = &mut s2; // mutable reference
s2_ref.push_str(" world!");
```

#text(size: 20pt,)[*Copy, Move & Clone*]
```rust 
// Simple values which implement the Copy trait are copied by value
let x = 5;
let y = x;
println!("{}", x); // x is still valid
// The string is moved to s2 and s1 is invalidated
let s1 = String::from("Welcometo Workshop");
let s2 = s1; // Shallow copy a.k.a move
println!("{}", s1); // Error: s1 is invalid
let s1 = String::from("Welcometo Workshop");
let s2 = s1.clone(); // Deep copy
// Valid because s1 isn't moved
println!("{}", s1);
